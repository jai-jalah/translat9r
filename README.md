## Demo

### Why and How

My goals for this project were to practise and demonstrate my abilities as a Full Stack Node.js & React Engineer. I did this by doing the following:

1. Writing high quality, readable, and scalable business logic, algorithms and backend REST APIs (Node.js, Express.js).
2. Hooking those APIs up to a pleasing UI (React)
3. Storing and Accessing State using Redux.

I also tried to mimic the process of a Commercial team as closely as possible whilst adhering to the nature of a solo project - I will created, reviewed and merge branches and Pull Requests.

I would rebase my commits before pushing a PR or merge in a Production environment, but I left my commits as they are in this project to showcase my process.
