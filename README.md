# Number to Word List Convertor

### What

React, Redux and Node app - converts a given numeric string into a list of corresponding words in the style of [T9](<https://en.wikipe.ia.org/wiki/T9_(predictive_text)>) / [Phonewords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneword).

### Why and How

My goals for this project are to practise and demonstrate my abilities as a Full Stack Node.js & TypeScript Engineer. I will do this by doing the following:

1. Architecting and designing my application at a high-level (MVC, Wireframes/Mock-Ups with Figma, Domain Models, TDD Tables and Pseudo-Code).
2. Writing high quality, readable, and scalable business logic, algorithms and backend REST APIs (Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript), using test-driven development (Jest).
3. Hooking those APIs up to an interactive UX and pleasing UI (React, TypeScript), using test-driven development (Jest, Cypress).
4. Implementing Redux - to persist user data and/or state between sessions, without a database. Maybe TDD (Jest, Enzyme, Redux TDD).

I will also try to mimic the process of a Commercial team as closely as possible. This means that I will create, review and merge branches and Pull Requests, and document my progress and project info in this repo's [Wiki](https://github.com/jai-jk/number-to-word-list-convertor/wiki). You can see the start of the project by checking out the [Initial Plan](https://github.com/jai-jk/number-to-word-list-convertor/wiki/Initial-Plan).

I will also deploy to Heroku!
